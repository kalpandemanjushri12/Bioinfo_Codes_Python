# Python_In_Bioinformatics
This respository consist of few set of python codes which is used in bioinformatics
1. The first Python script (DNA_TO_RNA) simulates the transcription process, converting a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence. In biological systems, transcription is a vital step in gene expression, where DNA is transcribed into RNA, replacing Thymine (T) with Uracil (U). This will takes a DNA sequence as input and outputs the transcribed RNA sequence.

2. The second Python script(k-mer_occurence) allows users to extract and analyze k-mers (subsequences of length k) from a given DNA sequence. This is useful for identifying recurring patterns, analyzing genetic motifs, and studying sequence complexity in biological data.
